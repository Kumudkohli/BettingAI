# BettingAI

Welcome to the Betting Using AI with Arbitrage Method project repository. In this project, we leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the arbitrage betting strategy to potentially profit from sports betting markets. This README will guide you through the project, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.

## Introduction
Betting on sports events is a popular pastime, but it can also be approached as an investment opportunity. Arbitrage betting is a strategy that involves placing bets on all possible outcomes of a sporting event to guarantee a profit, regardless of the actual result. This project combines the principles of arbitrage betting with AI to identify favourable betting opportunities and increase the chances of making a profit.

## How It Works
The project combines two key components: arbitrage betting and artificial intelligence.

- Arbitrage Betting: The arbitrage.py module implements the arbitrage betting algorithm. It takes in odds data from various sportsbooks and identifies opportunities where you can place bets on all outcomes of an event, ensuring a profit. It calculates the optimal bet sizes and provides recommendations.

- Artificial Intelligence: The model.py module contains an AI model trained on historical odds data. This model helps in predicting the probabilities of different outcomes, which is crucial for making informed arbitrage betting decisions.

## Usage
To use this project effectively:

1. Set up your environment variables and configuration for accessing sports betting odds data. Refer to the project documentation for details.
2. Use the provided AI model to predict outcome probabilities.
3. Utilize the arbitrage betting algorithm to identify profitable betting opportunities.
4. Place bets on the recommended outcomes and track your betting portfolio.
5. Continuously monitor and adjust your betting strategy as the odds change.

Please note that sports betting involves financial risk, and this project does not guarantee profits. It is essential to practice responsible gambling and only bet what you can afford to lose.
